(Every so often, I have "clever monkey" moments.  These are little
creative flashes, insight or non-linear solutions to problems.  They
make me think I might, in fact, be half as clever as people seem to
think I am.  Which would make me twice as clever as I usually feel.)
</p>
<p>
For instance, the other evening, I wanted to wash the pillow slips for
my feather pillows.  You know those little zipper thingies you put
around a feather pillow, to contain the feathers that sneak out?
Those things.
</p>
<p>
This process is akin to cracking open a nuclear containment vessel,
but instead of blue light that gives you cancer, you get a cloud of
loose little feathers that stick to everything and look silly.  And,
if you simply wash the cover with feathers in it, they stick to the
inside of your washing machine and show up on your clothes for weeks
to come.
</p>
<p>
In the past, my solution to this has been to put on a nice linen
shirt, go outside, and flail the feathery pillow slip around.  Then, I
carry out the pillow and whack it around for a bit.  There were little
white drifts in my back yard last time, in California, in August.  And
i still had the damned things in my hair for days.
</p>
<p>
What I really wanted was a second container for this.  I consider
doing all that inside a trash bag, or a grocery bag.  Maybe I could
tie the bag up, all puffy, and then beat it around for a bit.  All
good ideas, but there's still the problem of opening the bag up.  What
you need is a filter on the bag as you open it up and the air comes
out.
</p>
<p>
Or, you can just stick the whole assembly in the dryer, open it up,
and extract in there.  Then, close the dryer, and run air through it
for a little while.  Et voila!  All the feathers are handily
sequestered in your standard filter, the pillows are delightfully
fluffed, and the slip are wonderfully, well, de-fluffed.
