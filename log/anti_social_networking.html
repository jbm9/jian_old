This week, I did something tantamout to virtual suicide.  I went
through my social networking profiles and disabled, deactivated, or
deleted most of them. After much consideration, it became clear that
social networking sites were bad for my relationships, bad for for my
social life, and generally bad for me.
</p>
<p>
Social networking sites are the high-fructose corn syrup of social
interaction.  High-fructose corn syrup in food is trouble for two
reasons: it doesn't nourish you, nor does it fill you up.  Similarly,
social networking makes you feel like you're involved in another
person's life, without providing the nourishing fulfillment meaningful
interaction gives.  You get a brief glimmer of fulfillment when you
read a snippet of your friend's life, but it wears off quickly,
leaving you needing more interaction.  This means that you'll visit
the site again, which is perfect for the provider: they get another
set of ad views.
</p>
<p>Don't believe me when I say it's less fulfilling?  Let's try a
thought experiment.  You might get a brief burst of warm fuzzies when
someone posts pictures of their newborn baby on facebook, but it's
short-lived.  Contrast this with someone walking around the office
with cameraphone pictures of the same baby.  There's a real difference
in the quality of these two interactions: the in-person interaction is
more affecting than the online one.  There are myriad reasons for
this, but the important thing is that the in-person, in-depth,
in-excitement experience is much richer and more fulfilling than the
mediated, short, distant experience of facebook.
</p>
<p>
Of course, high-fructose corn syrup is okay in moderation, when
balanced out with something healthy.  Enjoy a Coke when you go see a
movie or are stuck in the airport.  It's a nice thing, in balance.
Similarly, social networking is fine if it's balanced out with more
healthy interactions.  That comes down to a sort of self-control,
which is where I have a hard time, and what finally pushed me over the
edge.
</p>
<p>
I'm a bit of a work-a-holic, having a hard time with work-life
balance.  I have an intense day job at a startup, where I'm a third of
the engineering team.  When I get home in the evening, I tinker on
personal projects: more software, writing a book or two, and studying
new things.  I find a lot of satisfaction in these things, and
therefore overdo it.  In fact, I overdo it so much that my friends
won't see me (in person) for weeks at a time.  But they'll see my
facebook status update every other day or so, "Josh looks forward to
taking a day off," or "Josh is finally shipping his pet project!"
</p>
<p>
Social networking sites make it too easy to "work friends in" around
your schedule.  They're an enabler for this sort of thing, both in
scheduling and perception.  If I had to go to dinner to see my
friends, I would make sure the few hours were well-spent, and connect
with the other people.  I might even stop thinking about work for a
while.  Social networking sites, however, reduce the cost of
socializing, which is a great thing for keeping in vague touch with
people.  Unfortunately, this reduces the perceived value of
relationships: there's less social capital invested in these short
bursts of activity.  This, in turn, makes them less seem meaningful to
the participants.
</p>
<p>
The perception of value is a funny thing.  In dating, there's a reason
people play hard to get.  It's the same reason that food you cooked
yourself tastes better.  Somewhere in the back of our brains, there's
a tiny beancounter, keeping track of how much time, money, and emotion
we've put into things.  This little accountant isn't always rational
or consistent, but generally, the more you put into a thing, the more
valuable you find it.  By reducing the cost of relationships, social
networking sites accidentally trick us into thinking our relationships
are less valuable.
</p>
<p>
Of course, often the relationships <em>are</em> less valuable.  It is
possible to hold truly deep and meaningful discussions with people
online.  It's a great medium for this, just as television is a great
medium for teaching people.  In television, you can show animated
graphs, moving diagrams, and demonstrate experiments, all with
expository notes (think <i>Mythbusters</i>).  What's television
actually used for?  <i>Fear Factor</i>, <i>Maury Povich</i>, and so
on.  Similarly, social networking sites don't typically make good use
of the medium.  They encourage lots of short interactions, which are
really great for ad revenue, but are terrible for meaningful
connections.
</p>
<p>
Some sites are better than others for this, and allow you to grow a
group of really great friends.  This, though, also poses a problem.
There's always someone out there to listen and offer advice.
Therefore, you never have to think for yourself.  Which means you
never make your own decisions/mistakes in a vacuum.  And,
correspondingly, you're never forced into full independence.
Collaboration is a great tool for developing new ideas, but it might
not be the best thing for one's internal life, as it tends to
encourage this sort of promiscuous codependency.
</p>
<p>
Now that the accounts are closed and the bookmarks are deleted, what
do I do next?  First, I set up a public Google
Calendar.  <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=josh.myer%40gmail.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles">Josh's
Google Calendar</a> is a good first approximation of whether or not
I'm busy at a given time.  It's also a good motivator, reminding
myself of the fact that I haven't seen people in X days, and maybe I
should get out more.
</p>
<p>
Next, it's time to really clean up my house, so I feel confident in
having people around more often.  The war on slightly embarassing
dustbunnies is nigh.  After that, it's time to start collecting
people's phone numbers.  Along with this, I need to get better about
calling people to hang out more often.
</p>
<p>Maybe I should just create a new event on facebook and invite everyone.</p>
