<p>I've recently been learning Haskell.  As part of that, I'm
implementing <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman Coding</a>.
This is my first real project in the language.  It's been overall
quite pleasant, and has taught me a lot.</p>
<p>The biggest lesson has been thoroughly meta: <b>compression tasks are a great way to learn
a language/environment.</b> For this project, I had to learn how to
use modules, do I/O, mangle arrays, and define tree structures.  It
might not look like too much, but that's actually a huge amount of
stuff to shove into a couple weekends of hacking.</p>
<p>Other things I've learned (or relearned), in no particular order:
<ul>
<li> You'll get a reasonable answer if you hop on IRC to for help in #haskell.
<li> "You remember the mental leap from imperative languages to OCaml?
I had about the same level of change going from OCaml to Haskell."  --
My friend <a href="http://neugierig.org/">Evan</a>, talking about
Haskell (he convinced me to try it, at least).
<li> The language-of-the-month club is incredibly time-consuming.  It
took <em>forever</em> to get really basic stuff down in a new language
(and I even had the benefit of having already coded some in OCaml).
<li> A good book makes all the difference.  I highly recommend <i><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Haskell-Craft-Functional-Programming-2nd/dp/0201342758">The
Craft of Functional Programming</a></i>.  It's a great book, even if
you've already been programming in other functional languages.
