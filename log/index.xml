<p>
So, over on <a href="http://del.icio.us/jbm">my del.icio.us</a>
account, you'll find a link to download the Roku's firmware image.  I
thought I should mention that in a venue more people will see.  I'm
keen to share notes with anyone who's also poking at this.  To prove
you're serious, please include the significance of 192.168.251.0 in
any introductory emails on Roku stuff.  Feel free to pass this on to
others of a curious bent, as I'm sure there's plenty for people to
poke at.
</p>

<p>
The NED (Netflix Device) is quite a slick little box, and I highly
recommend it if you're a Netflix Watch-it-now addict like
me.  <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i>, <i>The Outer
Limits</i>, <i>Little Britain</i>... really, this is a great way to
watch classic television.  <s>It'd be great if Roku would fulfill
their obligations under the GPL, as I've got one of their boxes in my
grubby little paws as we speak.</s> Whoops, spoke too soon!  They have
released
source: <a href="http://www.roku.com/community/gpl_nfp.php">Roku
Netflix Player GPL sources</a>.  Thank you, Roku!

</p>

<p>
In other news, I'm between jobs at the moment.  Since I'm no longer
there, I can mention that I was
at <a href="http://www.paglo.com/">Paglo Labs</a>, which is a cool
idea.  Someday I'll likely regret leaving the place.  Unfortunately,
the role wasn't really fitting as time went on (but, I stuck it out
through the crunch of the Public Beta launch).  There are about four
people who seem to be warming to the idea of my employ, but I'm always
keen to find more potential positions.  There are likely two more
going into the top of the hopper in the next day or two, but if you
know anyone looking for an information person, let me know (that's
stuff like data mining, search, or machine learning).  Mo' option, mo'
better.

<title>A Revival of Sorts</title>

<div class="content">

<p>
Saturday was the unveiling of the Computer History
Museum's <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/">Difference
Engine</a>.  Unfortunately, I missed it because I was half-zonked on
the couch all day with something like strep throat.  That was a
bummer, but it's okay, I had a bit of a religious revival.
</p>

<p>
Trolling around Google Video for something interesting, I came across
<a href="http://research.google.com/video.html">Google's Tech
Talks</a> again.  A total gold mine (and it'd be even better if people
knew how to use microphones).  
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2991826988639082519&q=Google+%22Google+Tech+Talks%22+duration%3Along&hl=en">Supporting
Scalable Online Statistical Processing</a> was really interesting,
about using statistical mechanisms and randomized algorithms to
numerically optimize really hard SQL queries.  I recommend it as a
different way of thinking about working with large datasets.
</p>

<p>
However, the really significant talk for me
was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyzOUbkUf3M">The Next
Generation of Neural Networks</a>,
by <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/">Geoffrey Hinton</a>.
In it, he presents a new twist on good
ole <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectionism/">connectionism</a>.
This is one hell of a demo, despite the Chomsky-esque annoying political asides.
</p>

<p>
&quot;I am interested in what you say and would like to subscribe to
your newsletter.&quot; It reaffirms my belief in the plausibility of
neural networks.  There's a long way to go until they're practical,
but this demo makes it clear that the promise is still there.  I'm
back in the fold, I believe again.  No pulpit-pounding required, no
fire and brimstone.  Just the promise of heaven in a clean, intuitive,
fundamentally simple model.
</p>

<p>
The best part, though, is that they publish all the code for this on
his website.  Unfortunately, it's in Matlab; fortunately, it runs in
octave.  When I've been up to it (ie: the few hours I was less
feverish Sunday), I've started porting it to C++ with GSL, mostly to
fully understand the underlying structure.
</p>

<p>
For now, though, I should get back to sleep.  Tomorrow morning: to the
doctor's, then hopefully to work.  I've run out of watchable movies on
Netflix on-demand, and, quite frankly, can't stand the idea of
sleeping away another day when there's cool stuff to be done.

<title>Anti-Social Networking</title>
<link>http://www.joshisanerd.com/log/anti_social_networking.html</link>
<dc:date>2008-04-19T21:17:45Z</dc:date>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<div class="content">

<p>
This week, I did something tantamout to virtual suicide.  I went
through my social networking profiles and disabled, deactivated, or
deleted most of them. After much consideration, it became clear that
social networking sites were bad for my relationships, bad for for my
social life, and generally bad for me.
</p>

<p>
Social networking sites are the high-fructose corn syrup of social
interaction.  High-fructose corn syrup in food is trouble for two
reasons: it doesn't nourish you, nor does it fill you up.  Similarly,
social networking makes you feel like you're involved in another
person's life, without providing the nourishing fulfillment meaningful
interaction gives.  You get a brief glimmer of fulfillment when you
read a snippet of your friend's life, but it wears off quickly,
leaving you needing more interaction.  This means that you'll visit
the site again, which is perfect for the provider: they get another
set of ad views.
</p>


<p>Don't believe me when I say it's less fulfilling?  Let's try a
thought experiment.  You might get a brief burst of warm fuzzies when
someone posts pictures of their newborn baby on facebook, but it's
short-lived.  Contrast this with someone walking around the office
with cameraphone pictures of the same baby.  There's a real difference
in the quality of these two interactions: the in-person interaction is
more affecting than the online one.  There are myriad reasons for
this, but the important thing is that the in-person, in-depth,
in-excitement experience is much richer and more fulfilling than the
mediated, short, distant experience of facebook.
</p>

<p>
Of course, high-fructose corn syrup is okay in moderation, when
balanced out with something healthy.  Enjoy a Coke when you go see a
movie or are stuck in the airport.  It's a nice thing, in balance.
Similarly, social networking is fine if it's balanced out with more
healthy interactions.  That comes down to a sort of self-control,
which is where I have a hard time, and what finally pushed me over the
edge.
</p>

<p>
I'm a bit of a work-a-holic, having a hard time with work-life
balance.  I have an intense day job at a startup, where I'm a third of
the engineering team.  When I get home in the evening, I tinker on
personal projects: more software, writing a book or two, and studying
new things.  I find a lot of satisfaction in these things, and
therefore overdo it.  In fact, I overdo it so much that my friends
won't see me (in person) for weeks at a time.  But they'll see my
facebook status update every other day or so, "Josh looks forward to
taking a day off," or "Josh is finally shipping his pet project!"
</p>

<p>
Social networking sites make it too easy to "work friends in" around
your schedule.  They're an enabler for this sort of thing, both in
scheduling and perception.  If I had to go to dinner to see my
friends, I would make sure the few hours were well-spent, and connect
with the other people.  I might even stop thinking about work for a
while.  Social networking sites, however, reduce the cost of
socializing, which is a great thing for keeping in vague touch with
people.  Unfortunately, this reduces the perceived value of
relationships: there's less social capital invested in these short
bursts of activity.  This, in turn, makes them less seem meaningful to
the participants.
</p>

<p>
The perception of value is a funny thing.  In dating, there's a reason
people play hard to get.  It's the same reason that food you cooked
yourself tastes better.  Somewhere in the back of our brains, there's
a tiny beancounter, keeping track of how much time, money, and emotion
we've put into things.  This little accountant isn't always rational
or consistent, but generally, the more you put into a thing, the more
valuable you find it.  By reducing the cost of relationships, social
networking sites accidentally trick us into thinking our relationships
are less valuable.
</p>

<p>
Of course, often the relationships <em>are</em> less valuable.  It is
possible to hold truly deep and meaningful discussions with people
online.  It's a great medium for this, just as television is a great
medium for teaching people.  In television, you can show animated
graphs, moving diagrams, and demonstrate experiments, all with
expository notes (think <i>Mythbusters</i>).  What's television
actually used for?  <i>Fear Factor</i>, <i>Maury Povich</i>, and so
on.  Similarly, social networking sites don't typically make good use
of the medium.  They encourage lots of short interactions, which are
really great for ad revenue, but are terrible for meaningful
connections.
</p>

<p>
Some sites are better than others for this, and allow you to grow a
group of really great friends.  This, though, also poses a problem.
There's always someone out there to listen and offer advice.
Therefore, you never have to think for yourself.  Which means you
never make your own decisions/mistakes in a vacuum.  And,
correspondingly, you're never forced into full independence.
Collaboration is a great tool for developing new ideas, but it might
not be the best thing for one's internal life, as it tends to
encourage this sort of promiscuous codependency.
</p>


<p>
Now that the accounts are closed and the bookmarks are deleted, what
do I do next?  First, I set up a public Google
Calendar.  <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=josh.myer%40gmail.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles">Josh's
Google Calendar</a> is a good first approximation of whether or not
I'm busy at a given time.  It's also a good motivator, reminding
myself of the fact that I haven't seen people in X days, and maybe I
should get out more.
</p>

<p>
Next, it's time to really clean up my house, so I feel confident in
having people around more often.  The war on slightly embarassing
dustbunnies is nigh.  After that, it's time to start collecting
people's phone numbers.  Along with this, I need to get better about
calling people to hang out more often.
</p>

<p>Maybe I should just create a new event on facebook and invite everyone.</p>

<title>Introducing TDIK</title>
<link>http://www.joshisanerd.com/log/intro_tdik.html</link>
<dc:date>2008-03-21T04:09:48Z</dc:date>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<div class="content">
<h3>Introducing TDIK</h3>

<p><small><i>(obdisclaimer: I don't speak for my employer here, and
this is my idea, not theirs.)</i></small></p>

<p>
Quick summary: Applying machine learning to uncover bottlenecks,
predict system capacity, user growth, hardware purchases, and,
generally, everything you need to know when running a service-based
business.  You give it your monitor data, and it gives you a
diagnostic and predictive model of your system.
</p>


<p>
Time Data Into Knowledge (TDIK) is an idea I had a little over a year
ago.  Since I've talked with several people about it in that time,
it's no longer patentable in the US.  And, since I haven't actually
done more than a proof of concept, I wanted to make a full public
disclosure of the idea, in the hopes that it would inspire someone.
</p>

<p>
Imagine you have a multi-tier application stack, with fairly complete
monitors.  So, your frontend server, the message queues, databases,
and a few backend processes (bulk and on-line).  Additionally, assume
you've got complete monitors in this stack: the normal machine
telemetry (CPU usage, disk capacity, network utilization, etc), as
well as application-specific stuff, like number of users, hits per
second, message queue depth, etc.
</p>

<p>
Traditional monitoring systems give you graphs of all this; you do the
analysis.  The best you can hope for is a big display of all your
graphs together, then eyeball them for correlations.  You can shuffle
them around to make it easier, but it's still human work.  This kind
of correlation is great for fires, where you have a sudden large shift
in two variables and don't care about the precise magnitude of the
relations.  It's no good for a more valuable, big-picture task:
capacity planning, where the relationships are less pronounced and
more complicated.
</p>

<p>
That's where TDIK comes in.  There are ways to find out how correlated
two datasets are and then extract models of their relationship.  You
can expand these out to any number of combinations, though it gets
much more computationall expensive.  Once you have these models,
though, they're invaluable.
</p>

<p>
You can make a model of your system yourself, using your knowledge of
it.  Your model will probably be darned good, since you built the
thing.  I've done these, and not only are they fun, they're handy.
But there's always dark corners lurking around.  What's the
performance interaction of running MySQL and Squid on the same host,
for instance?  They're both memory-intensive, especially when big
requests are getting bandied about.  Ideally, I'd have separate
hardware for them, but, well, you know how that goes.
</p>

<p>
TDIK, since it's learning the model from scratch every time, will find
out how things interact on your particular system.  It discovers
correlations that don't seem straightforward, but make sense after the
fact.  Things like "Webserver load is highly correlated with the
number of user profile views in full mode" (you eventually discover
that someone accidentally left in the debug code that disables
template caching there).
</p>


<p>
TDIK's models are useful for more than troubleshooting, though.  You
can also use them for planning.  For instance, let's say your website
has N concurrent users.  Would you like to know how many users the
current system can support?  The model can tell you how many, and
which component will be your bottleneck.  Or, perhaps you know that
you want to be able to support some number of users.  The model could
tell you how much you'd need to scale each component in your current
system to get there.
</p>

<p>
What about firefighting?  Your model reflects the steady-state
performance of the overall system.  If you have the last few minutes
of monitor data, you can quickly re-correlate and see which components
don't fit the model.  In fact, you can see <em>exactly how much</em>
they don't fit the model, and prioritize the order in which your team
checks things out.
</p>

<p>
But why firefight in the first place?  Using that same correlation,
you can get alerts when the current state deviates appreciably from
the model.  One things I've always said about nagios alerts is that
"They're only as good as your experience and creativity."  If you
don't know that a failure mode is waiting, you're not going to have a
nagios alert prepared for it.  TDIK's model obviates that, since it
knows your system intimately.  It will notice the increase in CPU time
versus page hits even if the raw number of hits is low (say, at
midnight), letting you identify and avert the morning meltdown.
</p>

<p>
"So where do I download or buy this product, or pay for the service?" 
you ask.  Well, it's mostly still vapor.  I did a small
proof-of-concept, and found that modelling this many variables is
noisy.  And, honestly, I haven't had time to make this happen.  It
could probably be a startup, but I'm not certain of it yet.  Feel free
to drop me an email at <a
href="mailto:josh@joshisanerd.com">josh@joshisanerd.com</a> if you
feel otherwise.

<title>The Dryer: A Multi-tasker</title>

<div class="content">

<p>
(Every so often, I have "clever monkey" moments.  These are little
creative flashes, insight or non-linear solutions to problems.  They
make me think I might, in fact, be half as clever as people seem to
think I am.  Which would make me twice as clever as I usually feel.)
</p>

<p>
For instance, the other evening, I wanted to wash the pillow slips for
my feather pillows.  You know those little zipper thingies you put
around a feather pillow, to contain the feathers that sneak out?
Those things.
</p>

<p>
This process is akin to cracking open a nuclear containment vessel,
but instead of blue light that gives you cancer, you get a cloud of
loose little feathers that stick to everything and look silly.  And,
if you simply wash the cover with feathers in it, they stick to the
inside of your washing machine and show up on your clothes for weeks
to come.
</p>

<p>
In the past, my solution to this has been to put on a nice linen
shirt, go outside, and flail the feathery pillow slip around.  Then, I
carry out the pillow and whack it around for a bit.  There were little
white drifts in my back yard last time, in California, in August.  And
i still had the damned things in my hair for days.
</p>

<p>
What I really wanted was a second container for this.  I consider
doing all that inside a trash bag, or a grocery bag.  Maybe I could
tie the bag up, all puffy, and then beat it around for a bit.  All
good ideas, but there's still the problem of opening the bag up.  What
you need is a filter on the bag as you open it up and the air comes
out.
</p>

<p>
Or, you can just stick the whole assembly in the dryer, open it up,
and extract in there.  Then, close the dryer, and run air through it
for a little while.  Et voila!  All the feathers are handily
sequestered in your standard filter, the pillows are delightfully
fluffed, and the slip are wonderfully, well, de-fluffed.

<title>Huffman Coding (in Haskell)</title>
<link>http://www.joshisanerd.com/log/huffman.html</link>
<dc:date>2008-02-27T10:01:47Z</dc:date>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<div class="content">

<p>I've recently been learning Haskell.  As part of that, I'm
implementing <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman Coding</a>.
This is my first real project in the language.  It's been overall
quite pleasant, and has taught me a lot.</p>

<p>The biggest lesson has been thoroughly meta: <b>compression tasks are a great way to learn
a language/environment.</b> For this project, I had to learn how to
use modules, do I/O, mangle arrays, and define tree structures.  It
might not look like too much, but that's actually a huge amount of
stuff to shove into a couple weekends of hacking.</p>

<p>Other things I've learned (or relearned), in no particular order:
<ul>

<li> You'll get a reasonable answer if you hop on IRC to for help in #haskell.

<li> "You remember the mental leap from imperative languages to OCaml?
I had about the same level of change going from OCaml to Haskell."  --
My friend <a href="http://neugierig.org/">Evan</a>, talking about
Haskell (he convinced me to try it, at least).

<li> The language-of-the-month club is incredibly time-consuming.  It
took <em>forever</em> to get really basic stuff down in a new language
(and I even had the benefit of having already coded some in OCaml).

<li> A good book makes all the difference.  I highly recommend <i><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Haskell-Craft-Functional-Programming-2nd/dp/0201342758">The
Craft of Functional Programming</a></i>.  It's a great book, even if
you've already been programming in other functional languages.

      <div class="content">


<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>

This is a really great introduction to both functional programming in
general, and the Haskell language in particular.  I would like to
note, though, that it focuses on the HUGS implementation of Haskell,
instead of GHC.  That's not a big deal, but it seems that GHC is
generally preferred by the community.

</p>

<p>
It's also readable, which I particularly appreciated.  At the time, I
was commuting by train, and happily lugged this book around.  It was
perfect for me, as both an introduction to the Haskell environment and
a brush-up on functional languages.

<h3>Reawakening the blog</h3>

<p>If I may quote myself rom the <a href="first_post.html">first post here</a>:
<blockquote>So, this is the first post using my new "blog engine," which is
just a messy set of of perl scripts, make, and the C pre-processor
from GCC.  At some point, I'll move over to something a bit more
appropriate, but this works wonderfully for now.  I think.</blockquote></p>

<p>I never quite got around to fixing it up and settling it in.  Then
I stopped caring.  Now, however, I feel like I should have a more
active presence here.  I've got a few little projects going, and feel
like a personal outlet could be beneficial.</p>

<p>Therefore, I've dusted off the perl scripts, the macros, and the
Makefile, and am bringing blog back.</p>

      <div class="content">


<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>
I really cannot read this book.  I've tried, time and time again, and
I've made some headway.  It's one of those math books in the formal
school: unbelievably dense, beginning with a set of abstract theorems,
then builds up to the useful stuff.  But, until you get past some
critical point, all you're doing is serious mathematical navel-gazing.
Normally, I'm a big fan of equations for equations' sakes, but I need statistics to <em>apply</em> them.
</p>

<p>
I basically gave up on this book and picked up
__REF(practical_statistics, Practical Statistics) instead.  It's much
easier going, if less rigorous.

<p>

Odalisque was a nice conclusion for the first volumen of the
<i>Baroque Cycle</i>.  There are a few "erotic" scenes which are
moderately titillating, but not really to my taste.  Beyond that, I
don't have too much to say without looking over the book again.  It
continues the Baroque Cycle, and is worth reading if you like
Stephenson

<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>

It's heavy, the print is hideous, and the paper smells funny.  As a
book, i hate it, but the content is redeeming.  If you're looking for
a worked example of a given statistical procedure, you can probably
find it in this book.  And, if you're lucky, it'll be one of the
homework problems in the book you're reading.

</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
Many of the tests in __REF(practical_statistics, Practical Statistics)
that get mentioned in this book include a worked example from Langley.
Especially helpful was the Wilcoxon Stratified example, since
Langley's explanations are often too verbose to actually read
(instead, just follow along with his working of the problem)...

<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>
The collection of papers flows nicely, especially with Jacquette's
introductions.  I will probably be taking notes on each paper
individually soon, but that's currently on the back burner.

<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>
This two-volume set is great reading, with a lot of breadth and a
little bit of depth.  I'm still finishing up the second volume,
slowly, trying to enjoy it as I go along.

<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
"Enormous effort was expended on the science of grammar--on the the parts of speech, on gender, on mood, tense, the conjugation of verbse, and similar delights" -- vI p29

<br/><br/>

"All great scientists are poets; many are mystics." -- vI p65

<br/><br/>

Voltaire was the foremost figure who seized upon the Lisbon
earthquake as an opportunity to attack the climate of optimism.  The
chief target of his attack was what he called the <i>tout est bien</i>
philosophy expressed twenty years earlier in Alexander Pope's
&quot;Essay on Man.&quot; In the preface to the <i>Po&egrave;m sur le
d&eacute;astre de Lisbonn</i>, Voltaire made some devastating points.
If, he asked, when Lisbon was destroyed, the philosophers had said to
the wretched survivors, &quot;Whatever happens is for the best; the
heirs of the dead will benefit financially; the building trade will
enjoy a boom; animals will grow fat on meals provided by the corpses
trapped in the debris; an earthquake is a necessary effect of a
neccessary cause; private misfortune must not be overrated; an
individualwho is unlucky is contributing to the general
good&quot;--would not such a speech be as cruel as the earthequake was
destructive?  We must admit, said Voltaire, that there is injustice
and evil in the world, that there is inexcusable suffering, that there
rae inexplicable calamities.  It is stupid and self-deluding to
pretend that every misfortune is a benefit in disguise.  It is folly o
believe that Providence will assure safe-conduct to the virtuous.  Man
is &quot;weak and helpless, ignorant of his destiny, and exposed to
terrible dangers, as all must now see.&quot;  Optimisim must be
replaced by realism; at best, but an &quot;apprehensive hope that
Providence will lead us through our dangerous world to a happier
state.&quot; -- vI p82

<br/><br/>

"There is no evidence, of course, that a single scientific discovery
eer was made by induction as conceived by Bacon.  On the contrary it
is quite clear that to engage in research without the stimulus and
guidance of hypotheses, rules, preconceptions, anticipations, control
criteria and the like is a hopeless if not indeed frivolous activity.
Abundeant spport for this conclusion may be found throughout the
literature of science, and proof of the futility of "pure induction"
is not lacking in Bacon's own records of research." -- vI p91

<br/><br/>

Tartaglia did not take Cardan's betrayal lightly.  The feud was long and acrid, marked by many challeneges, appeals to the public conscience, and mutual denunciations.  Mathematics was a serious business in those days. -- vI p104

<br/><br/>

Illustrious men are required to say deathless things on their deathbeds.  Laplace is said to have departed after expressing the reasonable opinion, "What we know is very slight; what we don't know is immense."  De Morgan, observing that "this looks like a parody on Newton's pebbles," claims on close authority to have learned Laplace's very last words: "Man follows only phantoms." -- vI p138

<br/><br/>

Whatever Clifford tackled was carried through with a drive that reflected not merely his eagerness for mastery but his joy in living things out to the full.  He studied French, German, and Spanish because he thought them necessary for his work; Arabic, Greek, and Sanskrit because they were difficult and, because difficult, a challenege; hieroglyphics because they were a riddle.  His justification for learning the Morse code and shorthand was that he was interested in all methods of conveying thought, but this was not the only instance where the little boy in him had to be rationalized. -- vI p201

<br/><br/>

Galton was ont a mathematician but he was mathematically minded.  He had what amounted to an obsession to count and measure (one of his maxims was: "Whenever you can, count"), and he applied this urge to anything and everything.  In his laboratory he measured heads, noses, arms, legs, color of eyes and hair, breathing power, "strength of pull and of squeeze," keenness of sight and of hearing, reaction time, height, weight, and so on.  He compiled statistics of the weather, of the properties of heiresses, of life span, of the inheritance of physical and mental characters.  He counted the number of "fidgets" per miute among persons attending lectures--apparently to derive a coefficient of boredom.  Middle-aged persons, he found, are medium fidgets, "children are raretly still, while elderly philosophers will sometimes remain rigid for minutes altogethere."  He made a "beauty map" of the British Isles, classifying the girls he passed in the streets of various towns as "attractive, indifferent or repellent."  The method he employed was to prick holes in a piece of paper, "torn rudely into a cross with a lon leg," which he concealed within his pocket.  London ranked highest; Aberdeen lowest. -- vI p252

<br/><br/>

Then in 1918 [Russell] was sent to prison for pacifist propaganda.
The specific charge against him was that he had written a pamplet
accusing the United States Army of "intimidating strikes at home."  By
th eintervention of Arthur Balfour, prison life was made easier for
him and he could read and write as much as he liked provided he did no
propaganda.  In four and a half months he wrote his famous
<i>Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</i>, a book that has
brought to many of us the first heady experience of Russell's thought
and style, and begane the work for his <i>Analysis of Mind</i>.  The
governor of the prison found these writings perplexing but
unsubversive.  Similarly, a warder found nothin objectionable in
Russells reply to a question about his religion.  When he said that he
was an agnostic, the warder asked how to spell it and remarked with a
sigh: "Well, there are many religions, but I suppose they all worship
the same God."  Russell says "this remark kept me cheerful for about a
week." -- vII p46

<br/><br/>

It is easy to imagine that [Wittgenstein] frightened his students.  He
was impatient, irritable, insulting.  He drove himself, scourged
himself to achieve understanding, and was no more sparing of his
class.  THey respected his passionate honesty and, if not petrified,
were spurred to hard mental exertion; but two hours of such severee
and tense probing exhausted both teacher and pupils.  When it was
over, Wittegenstein, full of self-reproach, would eagerly seek relief
from his ordeal.  Often he would "rush off to a cinema immediately
after the class ended," taking a friend with him.  He would buy a bun
or an execrable English cold pork pie and munch it while he watched
the film.  He insisted on sitting in the front row so that the screen
"would occupy his entire field of vision, and his mind would be turned
away from the thoughts of the lecture and his feelings of revulsion."
No matter how wretched the picture, he became totally absorbed in
it. -- vII p62

<br/><br/>

White suggests dividing the philosophers of the twentieth century into
two groups, hedgehogs and foxes.  The image (recently revived by Sir
Isaiah Berlin in an essay on Tolstoy) is from a line of the Greek poet
Archilochus which says: "The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog
knows one big thing."  We must not expect too much of this image, but
it serves to contrast two main tendenceies.  On one side are teh
metaphysicists, the builders of monuments, who try to see the world in
terms of a central concept which is to organized all their attitudes
and beliefs.  These are the hedgehogs.  In their systems there is a
place for everything and everyone; all that the seen and unseen world
has been, is, and will be is explained.  Their philosophies may not
always be a comfort, but they are always complete.  There are no loose
ends or exceptions; loneliness and starfish, molecules and bills of
lading, greed and galaxies, time and art are embraced in a single
vision.  The other tendency is both more modest and more arrogant.
Its followers have a poor opinion of metaphysics They deny that
hilosophy has to do with world views, that it has any business
pronouncing grandly on religion, politics, morals, art or even
science.  Their tradition offers little support either to political or
religious movements, which is one of the reasons why it has so many
detractors. The logical-analysis foxes would like to know many little
things--instead of one big thing--but they are content to know even
<em>one</em> thing, pvoided they can get to know it very well.  One
may vary the image of the foxes, and think of the second tendency as
surgial.  Using the sharpest possible instruments of logic and
mathematics, these surgeons of philosophy are intent on excising small
muddles that, if untended, may grow into big muddles.  The object of
attention is not the world or man or marols, but sequences of
reasoning, sentences, even single words.  Logical analysts are
philosophers interested in the causes and cure of philosophy.  In time
they hope to put themselves out of business. -- vII pp69-70

<h3>Heathen Children Get Presents Too Day</h3>

<p>I'm currently in Chapel Hill, staying with <a
href="http://www.infomuse.net/">Kristina</a>.  We've done Heathen
Children Get Presents Too Day, which is like Christmas, but for those
of us who don't fit into the "Christian" category.  (I used to have
Atheist Children Get Presents Too Day for just myself, but broadened
it this year).</p>

<p>Between my folks and K, it's been a very good year for presents.
The real wins were a pocket hole jig and the charcoal <a
href="http://pigpog.com/node/1918">Lamy Safari</a>, in Fine.  I also
got the appropriate convertor, which is already loaded with <a

<h3>First Post</h3>

<p>So, this is the first post using my new "blog engine," which is
just a messy set of of perl scripts, make, and the C pre-processor
from GCC.  At some point, I'll move over to something a bit more
appropriate, but this works wonderfully for now.  I think.</p>

<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>
This is a really good, if hand-wavey, introduction to the ideas behind
statistics.  The important thing, though, is that it includes
instructions for a number statistical tests and a guide to when these
tests are applicable.  It is therefore ideal for people who are
looking for a gentle-ish introduction to statistical tests.
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
Most  of my notes from this will be found in the RStats library, which
is an implementation of most of the tests in the book (as well as some
from <i>Introduction to Statistical Inference</i>.
</p>


<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>

A remarkable example of estimating from a sample occured in the Second
World War, when German industrial output was estimated by British and
American statisticans from the serial numbers on captured equipment.
It was like taking a random sample of marbles from a bag containing
consecutively numbered marbles from 1 onwards, and then, with the hlp
of a simple formula utilizing the size of the sample and the highest
number observed in the sample, an estimate can made of the total
number of marbles in the bag.  According to checks made after the war,
many of these estimates were quite as accurate as those made by the
Germans themselves.

<br/>
-- W.A. Wallis and H. V. Robterts, <i>Statistics - A New Approach</i>, Free Press, 1960.

<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>
Like <i><a href="quicksilver.html">Quicksilver</a></i>, this was good fun.  It was slightly more enjoyable This was a wonderfully fun read, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  There were a few things that bothered me, though.  First and foremost was the way Stephenson put words foreshadowing Einstein into Newton's mouth.  It's just bad form, in my humble opinion, and felt like a belabored in-joke among those who would find it "ironic."

<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>(<i>Quicksilver</i> was the first novel I picked up after a long time without reading <em>any</em> novels, so my impressions might be skewwed.)</p>

<p>
This was an overall fun read, which I thoroughly enjoyed once I
accepted skimming its.  There were a few things that bothered me,
though.  The only one worth mentioning directly was Newton's
constantly foreshadowing Einstein.  It's just bad form, in my humble
opinion, and felt like a belabored in-joke among those who would find
it "ironic."
