<p>This is a page I'm trying to grow.  It will contain a more
organized, "permanent" set of links, while del.icio.us will continue
to be used for my current-ish set of bookmarks.
</p>

<P>I like to read pages of people who have Really Cool Ideas. I like
seeing pictures of random hacks/kludges/tweaks.  The ability to do this,
in my opinion, is the coolest thing about the web. Especially because if
someone has done one cool hack, they've usually done more than one. And
if they've taken the time to document that one, they've taken the time
to document more than one. I'll be adding to this as time goes on, so
bookmark it and check back when you get bored.</P>

So, in the name of wasting time with inspiring creations, the following list:<BR>
<UL>
<LI><a href="http://www.linux.org.uk/diary">Alan Cox</a>: Admittedly, this isn't always the most inspiring, but it does tend to refer to interesting hacks.
<LI><a href="http://www.monad.com/kurt/">Kurt Schaefer</a>: Electric Scooters, homemade kilns... neat stuff
<LI><a href="http://www.armory.com/~rstevew/">R. Steven Walz</a>: A nice hoarde of electronics information
<LI><a href="http://www.scitoys.com/">Simon Quellen Field</a>: Science Toys You 
Can Make With Your Kids. I think "or Your Nerdy Friends" is implied.
<LI><a href="http://www.lipsons.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/mathlego.htm">Andrew Lipson
</a>: Mathematical LEGO Sculptures. Like you haven't wondered what a Lego Moebiu
s strip would look like.

<LI><a href="http://www.dself.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/museum.htm">Douglas Self</a>: The Museum of RetroTechnology. Has a fair bit of Neat content.
