	  <p>Hi.  My name is Josh, and I am a nerd.  (A special hello
	  to everyone who comes here from typing "Josh is a" into
	  google and letting it autocomplete, and an extra special one
	  for those who get here by searching for "nerd" in google
	  images.)</p>

	  <p>Generally speaking, I'm an avid tinkerer and builder.
	  The mechanics of things fascinate me; when I see something
	  novel, my first thought is usually "How would I do that?"
	  My mother likes to remind me that, as soon as I learned to
	  get up and pull things off tabletops, there was never a
	  working pen in the house.  Since then, I've learned both
	  restraint and how to put things back in working order.  That
	  said, one of the benefits of living by yourself is that
	  nobody is around to catch you breaking something...</p>

	  <p>Lately, I have been spending a lot of time at <a
	  href="https://www.noisebridge.net/">noisebridge</a>, San
	  Francisco's <a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace">hackerspace</a>.
	  I facilitate the Machine Learning meetup, and am usually
	  leading another project, in addition to my usual
	  tinkering.</p>

	  <p>In 2006, I graduated from the University of North
	  Carolina at Chapel Hill with two degrees: one in
	  Mathematics, and the other in Linguistics.  By day, I
	  develop software and help machines learn.</p>
