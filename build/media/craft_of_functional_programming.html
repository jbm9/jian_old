<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>

This is a really great introduction to both functional programming in
general, and the Haskell language in particular.  I would like to
note, though, that it focuses on the HUGS implementation of Haskell,
instead of GHC.  That's not a big deal, but it seems that GHC is
generally preferred by the community.

</p>

<p>
It's also readable, which I particularly appreciated.  At the time, I
was commuting by train, and happily lugged this book around.  It was
perfect for me, as both an introduction to the Haskell environment and
a brush-up on functional languages.
