<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>

Odalisque was a nice conclusion for the first volumen of the
<i>Baroque Cycle</i>.  There are a few "erotic" scenes which are
moderately titillating, but not really to my taste.  Beyond that, I
don't have too much to say without looking over the book again.  It
continues the Baroque Cycle, and is worth reading if you like
Stephenson

<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p>
I have some quotes to put in here, but those will have to wait until I get it back from a friend.
