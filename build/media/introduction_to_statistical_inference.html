<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>
I really cannot read this book.  I've tried, time and time again, and
I've made some headway.  It's one of those math books in the formal
school: unbelievably dense, beginning with a set of abstract theorems,
then builds up to the useful stuff.  But, until you get past some
critical point, all you're doing is serious mathematical navel-gazing.
Normally, I'm a big fan of equations for equations' sakes, but I need statistics to <em>apply</em> them.
</p>

<p>
I basically gave up on this book and picked up
__REF(practical_statistics, Practical Statistics) instead.  It's much
easier going, if less rigorous.
