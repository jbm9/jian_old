<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>
Like <i><a href="quicksilver.html">Quicksilver</a></i>, this was good fun.  It was slightly more enjoyable This was a wonderfully fun read, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  There were a few things that bothered me, though.  First and foremost was the way Stephenson put words foreshadowing Einstein into Newton's mouth.  It's just bad form, in my humble opinion, and felt like a belabored in-joke among those who would find it "ironic."

<h3>Quotes</h3>

I have some quotes to put in here, but those will have to wait until I get it back from a friend.
