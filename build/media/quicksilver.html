<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>(<i>Quicksilver</i> was the first novel I picked up after a long time without reading <em>any</em> novels, so my impressions might be skewwed.)</p>

<p>
This was an overall fun read, which I thoroughly enjoyed once I
accepted skimming its.  There were a few things that bothered me,
though.  The only one worth mentioning directly was Newton's
constantly foreshadowing Einstein.  It's just bad form, in my humble
opinion, and felt like a belabored in-joke among those who would find
it "ironic."

<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p>
I have some quotes to put in here, but those will have to wait until I get it back from a friend.
