<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>

It's heavy, the print is hideous, and the paper smells funny.  As a
book, i hate it, but the content is redeeming.  If you're looking for
a worked example of a given statistical procedure, you can probably
find it in this book.  And, if you're lucky, it'll be one of the
homework problems in the book you're reading.

</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
Many of the tests in __REF(practical_statistics, Practical Statistics)
that get mentioned in this book include a worked example from Langley.
Especially helpful was the Wilcoxon Stratified example, since
Langley's explanations are often too verbose to actually read
(instead, just follow along with his working of the problem)...
