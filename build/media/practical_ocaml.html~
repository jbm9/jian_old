<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>

This is a really, really great introduction to both functional
programming in general, and the Haskell language in particular.  I
would like to note, though, that it focuses on the HUGS implementation
of Haskell, instead of GHC.  That's not a big deal, but it seems that
GHC is generally preferred by the community.
