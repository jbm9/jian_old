<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<blockquote>In 1974, the three-member Pulitzer Prize jury on fiction supported Gravity's Rainbow for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. However, the other eleven members of the board overturned this decision, branding the book "unreadable, turgid, overwritten, and obscene."<br/>
-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity's_Rainbow">Wikipedia: [[Gravity's Rainbow]]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>I have tried to read this book three times now.  I finally committed to it: i paid 15$ retail!  A few months in, there's sitll about a third to go, but the story is growing on me.  It's a very intricate yet vulgar piece of work, something like lacework made of entrails.</p>
