<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>
This is a really good, if hand-wavey, introduction to the ideas behind
statistics.  The important thing, though, is that it includes
instructions for a number statistical tests and a guide to when these
tests are applicable.  It is therefore ideal for people who are
looking for a gentle-ish introduction to statistical tests.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
Most  of my notes from this will be found in the RStats library, which
is an implementation of most of the tests in the book (as well as some
from <i>Introduction to Statistical Inference</i>.

<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>

A remarkable example of estimating from a sample occured in the Second
World War, when German industrial output was estimated by British and
American statisticans from the serial numbers on captured equipment.
It was like taking a random sample of marbles from a bag containing
consecutively numbered marbles from 1 onwards, and then, with the hlp
of a simple formula utilizing the size of the sample and the highest
number observed in the sample, an estimate can made of the total
number of marbles in the bag.  According to checks made after the war,
many of these estimates were quite as accurate as those made by the
Germans themselves.
