<h3>Hacking Knoppix</h3>

<P>I wrote chapter 7, "Clustering for Knoppix," for Wiley's <i><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764597841/">Hacking
Knoppix</a></i>.  It was published in early 2006.</p>


<h3>The Art of Computer Programming Reading Group</h3>

<p>I started a reading group to cover Knuth's <i>The Art of Computer
Programming</i> in a year.  That's about 1500 dense pages on theoretical
computer science in forty-something weeks.  The writeup and schedule are
available at the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/taocprg/">TAoCP RG Homepage</a>.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, after a very short period of time, this fell to the wayside.  The page and schedule are left up for anyone who has interest in their own push through TAoCP.</p>

<a name="muralizer"><H3>Muralizer</H3></a>

<P>Muralizer is a drawbot in the vein of <a
href="http://www.hektor.ch/">Hektor</a>.  It can be thought of as a
plotter, but one that draws on walls instead of sheets of paper in a
bed.  Muralizer will allow anyone to take a vector graphics file (such
as those produced by Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape) and turn it into a
mural.  This project involves XML parsing (SVG), slightly crazy math
(converting x-y cubic bézier curves into stepper motor controls),
microcontroller code, and physical design.  More details forthcoming
as the project gels further.</P>

<a name="perceptron"><H3>Perceptron</H3></a>

<P>Perceptron is an interactive dancefloor project headed by Jean
Rintoul.  Using an array of ultrasonic sensors and video capture with
computer vision, music and visuals are generated.  Perceptron was
first shown at <a
href="http://false-profit.com/2009/04/25/alchemy/">False Profit's
Alchemy</a>, and is currently being refined based on the lessons
learned from that showing. (<a

<a name="libpuz"><H3>libpuz</H3></a>

<P>PUZ is a file format used to store crossword puzzles.  The format
uses many different checksums and various magic values; none of this
was documented.  I spent about a week's worth of time (over the course
of a month) deducing the checksum routine and then figuring out how
it's applied to the data.  To finish off, i wrote a library that
implements the format, for both reading and writing PUZ files.  The
end result is <a href="http://www.joshisanerd.com/puz/">PUZ File
Format Specification</a> and <a
href="http://www.joshisanerd.com/puz/libpuz-latest.tar.gz">libpuz(-latest).tar.gz</a>.</P>

<a name="marginalia"><H3>Marginalia</H3></a>

<P>Marginalia was a firefox plugin which allowed you to add marginalia
(notes in the margin) to webpages.  It let you add these notes to a
given position in a given paragraph of a webpage.  I wrote this while
at <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/">ibiblio</a>, but it never really
took off outside myself.  Since then, other people have done the same
thing (some believing there's a business model to be found), but it's
hard to keep track of which projects are still around, so I won't even
try.  (<a href="http://www.joshisanerd.com/marginalia/">Marginalia
homepage</a>)</P>


<a name="dragon"><H3>Dragon Character Trainer</H3></a>

<P>This isn't really &quot;my&quot; project, per-se, but it's
something I was heavily involved in.  dragon-char is a Chinese
character (Hanzi) training program for the Palm.  You can find more
information about it at the <a
href="http://dragon-char.sourceforge.net/">Dragon Character
Homepage</a>. </P>

<a name="hebci"><H3>HEBCI</H3></a>

<P>HEBCI is a technique that allows a web form handler to
transparently detect the character set its data was encoded with.  A
complete writeup can be had at the <a
"href="http://www.joshisanerd.com/set/">HEBCI Homepage</a>.</P>

<a name="huffman"><H3>Huffman Demo (Haskell)</H3></a>

<P>This is a demo/framework app, written in Haskell.  It's a cheat
sheet of sorts for me, used to bootstrap new Haskell projects.
Because it's written in Literate Haskell, its documentation is a PDF.
You can look at <a
href="http://www.joshisanerd.com/projects/Huffman.pdf">Huffman
documentation</a>, or just download <a
href="http://www.joshisanerd.com/projects/HuffmanDemo-0.0.tar.gz">HuffmanDemo-0.0.tar.gz</a>.</P>

<a name="libedio"><H3>libedio</H3></a>

<P>A general-purpose network IO library with some handy unixy bits.
Basically, it allows you to quickly write network client code without
having to deal with all the networking-specific bits (buffering, etc),
which is really convenient. More information is available at the <a
href="http://libedio.sourceforge.net/">libedio Homepage</a>.</P>


<a name="portmuxer"><H3>PortMuxer</H3></a>

<P>Once upon a time, I worked a crappy job doing crappy work. At this
job, we didn't have Real Internet Access. We did, however, have access
to port 80, though it went through a slightly odd proxy. The important
part is that it didn't mess up stream connections. So, i wrote a
program that multiplexes a listener port, allowing HTTP, SSH, and
telnet over the same port.  Quite handy. Still a little rough around
the edges, but should be coming along nicely when i get the time to
actually work on it.<BR> <a
