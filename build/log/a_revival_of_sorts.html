Saturday was the unveiling of the Computer History
Museum's <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/">Difference
Engine</a>.  Unfortunately, I missed it because I was half-zonked on
the couch all day with something like strep throat.  That was a
bummer, but it's okay, I had a bit of a religious revival.
</p>

<p>
Trolling around Google Video for something interesting, I came across
<a href="http://research.google.com/video.html">Google's Tech
Talks</a> again.  A total gold mine (and it'd be even better if people
knew how to use microphones).  
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2991826988639082519&q=Google+%22Google+Tech+Talks%22+duration%3Along&hl=en">Supporting
Scalable Online Statistical Processing</a> was really interesting,
about using statistical mechanisms and randomized algorithms to
numerically optimize really hard SQL queries.  I recommend it as a
different way of thinking about working with large datasets.
</p>

<p>
However, the really significant talk for me
was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyzOUbkUf3M">The Next
Generation of Neural Networks</a>,
by <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/">Geoffrey Hinton</a>.
In it, he presents a new twist on good
ole <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectionism/">connectionism</a>.
This is one hell of a demo, despite the Chomsky-esque annoying political asides.
</p>

<p>
&quot;I am interested in what you say and would like to subscribe to
your newsletter.&quot; It reaffirms my belief in the plausibility of
neural networks.  There's a long way to go until they're practical,
but this demo makes it clear that the promise is still there.  I'm
back in the fold, I believe again.  No pulpit-pounding required, no
fire and brimstone.  Just the promise of heaven in a clean, intuitive,
fundamentally simple model.
</p>

<p>
The best part, though, is that they publish all the code for this on
his website.  Unfortunately, it's in Matlab; fortunately, it runs in
octave.  When I've been up to it (ie: the few hours I was less
feverish Sunday), I've started porting it to C++ with GSL, mostly to
fully understand the underlying structure.
</p>

<p>
For now, though, I should get back to sleep.  Tomorrow morning: to the
doctor's, then hopefully to work.  I've run out of watchable movies on
Netflix on-demand, and, quite frankly, can't stand the idea of
sleeping away another day when there's cool stuff to be done.
