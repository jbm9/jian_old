<h3>Reawakening the blog</h3>

<p>If I may quote myself rom the <a href="first_post.html">first post here</a>:
<blockquote>So, this is the first post using my new "blog engine," which is
just a messy set of of perl scripts, make, and the C pre-processor
from GCC.  At some point, I'll move over to something a bit more
appropriate, but this works wonderfully for now.  I think.</blockquote></p>

<p>I never quite got around to fixing it up and settling it in.  Then
I stopped caring.  Now, however, I feel like I should have a more
active presence here.  I've got a few little projects going, and feel
like a personal outlet could be beneficial.</p>

<p>Therefore, I've dusted off the perl scripts, the macros, and the
Makefile, and am bringing blog back.</p>
