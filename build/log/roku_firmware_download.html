So, over on <a href="http://del.icio.us/jbm">my del.icio.us</a>
account, you'll find a link to download the Roku's firmware image.  I
thought I should mention that in a venue more people will see.  I'm
keen to share notes with anyone who's also poking at this.  To prove
you're serious, please include the significance of 192.168.251.0 in
any introductory emails on Roku stuff.  Feel free to pass this on to
others of a curious bent, as I'm sure there's plenty for people to
poke at.

The NED (Netflix Device) is quite a slick little box, and I highly
recommend it if you're a Netflix Watch-it-now addict like
me.  <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i>, <i>The Outer
Limits</i>, <i>Little Britain</i>... really, this is a great way to
watch classic television.  <s>It'd be great if Roku would fulfill
their obligations under the GPL, as I've got one of their boxes in my
grubby little paws as we speak.</s> Whoops, spoke too soon!  They have
released

In other news, I'm between jobs at the moment.  Since I'm no longer
there, I can mention that I was
at <a href="http://www.paglo.com/">Paglo Labs</a>, which is a cool
idea.  Someday I'll likely regret leaving the place.  Unfortunately,
the role wasn't really fitting as time went on (but, I stuck it out
through the crunch of the Public Beta launch).  There are about four
people who seem to be warming to the idea of my employ, but I'm always
keen to find more potential positions.  There are likely two more
going into the top of the hopper in the next day or two, but if you
know anyone looking for an information person, let me know (that's
stuff like data mining, search, or machine learning).  Mo' option, mo'
better.
