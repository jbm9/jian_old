<h3>Heathen Children Get Presents Too Day</h3>

<p>I'm currently in Chapel Hill, staying with <a
href="http://www.infomuse.net/">Kristina</a>.  We've done Heathen
Children Get Presents Too Day, which is like Christmas, but for those
of us who don't fit into the "Christian" category.  (I used to have
Atheist Children Get Presents Too Day for just myself, but broadened
it this year).</p>

<p>Between my folks and K, it's been a very good year for presents.
The real wins were a pocket hole jig and the charcoal <a
href="http://pigpog.com/node/1918">Lamy Safari</a>, in Fine.  I also
got the appropriate convertor, which is already loaded with <a

Legal Lapis</a>.</p>
